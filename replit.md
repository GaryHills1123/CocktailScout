# Cocktail Scout - Hamilton Bar Discovery

## Overview

Cocktail Scout is a bar discovery application focused on Hamilton, Ontario. It combines an interactive map view with a searchable list to help users find the best bars and cocktail lounges based on a calculated "vibe score". The application ranks bars using a proprietary algorithm that considers ratings, review counts, price fairness, social activity (photo counts), and bar-specific keywords to create a 0-100 vibe score.

The application is built as a full-stack TypeScript project with a React frontend and Express backend, featuring a clean, bar-themed UI design with modern aesthetics and cocktail-focused branding.
