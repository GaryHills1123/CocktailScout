To use Map SDK (since version 2.0), you'll need a Map SDK API Key. Map SDK uses this API Key to associate API requests with your account and provide additional control and security for your maps and SDK functionality. To learn how to create new API Keys, update their settings, delete them, and how to use them with Map SDK, see Authentication.

The rest of this page contains setup information for the Map SDK:

The JavaScript package, allowing you to use the Map SDK in HTML and JavaScript/Typescript.
The Python package, allowing you to use the Map SDK in notebook environments.
JavaScript Setup
npm

The Map SDK can be used with pure JavaScript code, or integrated with any JavaScript UI framework.

The Map SDK also provides native Typescript typings.

If your project is using a bundler, you can install @foursquare/map-sdk as a module:

Shell

# yarn
yarn add @foursquare/map-sdk
# npm
npm i @foursquare/map-sdk

Or if you want to use it in plan JS and HTML, you can get the SDK directly from a CDN:

JavaScript

import { createMap } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@foursquare/map-sdk@latest/dist/index.js";
