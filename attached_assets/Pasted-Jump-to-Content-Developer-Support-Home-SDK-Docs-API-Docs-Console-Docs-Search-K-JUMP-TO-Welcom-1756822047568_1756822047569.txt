Find Nearby Places
get
https://api.foursquare.com/v3/places/nearby
Utilize Foursquare's Snap to Place technology to detect where your user's device is and what is around them.
The endpoint is designed to provide POI tagging that supports a check-in use case. It will intentionally return lower quality results not found in Place Search. It is not intended to replace Place Search as the primary way to search for top, recommended POIs.
