# vibecode ☕️

**find the best coffee vibes in Hamilton, Ontario**

---

## what’s this?
vibecode is a tiny map + list app that ranks Hamilton cafés by **vibe score**.  
it’s not science, it’s not snobby — it’s just a friendly way to decide *where the heck to grab your next latte*.

---

## how it works
- ⭐ ratings (higher = better)  
- 👥 review counts (because popularity counts too)  
- 💲 price balance (not too $$$, not too sketchy)  
- 🥸 secret coffee-nerd words (*roaster*, *single origin*, *pour over*)  

all shaken, not stirred → a **0–100 vibe score**.

---

## quick start (on replit)
1. fork/import this project.  
2. add `YELP_API_KEY` in Secrets (optional, but makes it juicier).  
3. click **Run**.  
4. explore Hamilton cafés, ranked by vibe.  

don’t wanna mess with keys? no worries — OSM fallback still works. ✨

## faq
**is this just Hamilton?**  
yep — it’s hometown love. expansion comes later.  

**do i need an account?**  
nope. zero logins, zero tracking. just vibes.  

**how fresh is the data?**  
cached for a few hours to keep the APIs happy.
